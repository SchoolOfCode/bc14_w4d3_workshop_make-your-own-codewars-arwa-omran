/* 
You're a huge Rihanna fan ðŸ’ƒ and have created a playlist of her greatest hits for your birthday party!
Each song in the playlist is represented as a duration in seconds, but you want to know how long the playlist is in minutes and seconds so that you can plan your party.
The playlistLength function takes the playlist (an array) as input and returns the total duration of the playlist in minutes and seconds, in the format mm:ss.
Don't worry, you won't have to "work work work work work" too hard on this one (or am I being unfaithful? ðŸ¤”)
HINT: Use the padStart() syntax to add a leading zero to the seconds if necessary.
*/

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
export function playlistLength(playlist) {
    // Your code here
};
